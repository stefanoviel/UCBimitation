do i need to understand the already implemented algos?
which environment should I start with? 
why my_gym is into another folder called my_gym? 
what does the number near trajs stands for?
what is this noise parameter? it's the noise in the environment
what are the number in reward and models (i.e. 1_2.p)? I run with different parameters and it produces different ones??
do all the experiments in the same folder need to be run with the same number of max-iter
