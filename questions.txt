do i need to understand the already implemented algos?
which environment should I start with? 

what does the number near trajs stands for?
what is this noise parameter? it's the noise in the environment it's the probability with wich I follow the action, otherwise I do one towards the center

what are the number in reward and models (i.e. 1_2.p)? I run with different parameters and it produces different ones??
do all the experiments in the same folder need to be run with the same number of max-iter? any idea why I'm getting the error with gail? 


next steps:
implement my algorithm
to which other algo should I compare it with?
