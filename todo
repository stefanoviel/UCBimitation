find way to diversity the z networks. Right now the trajectories are collected using the average z value for each, so the only diversity comes from the initialization. 

how are we handling exploration? 
which metric could I look at to get a better sense of the performance? 

questions: 
    why in the definition we say that z estimates V(s, a) isn't the value function supposed to be for the states?
